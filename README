nctyping -- light CLI for practicing typing

COMMENTS ======================================================================

nctyping recognizes and skips over comments in source code.  Recognition is
currently based on file extensions or leading "shebangs" (#!).  Currently
supported language and syntax combinations include:

    C, C++, C#, Java, Rust, D, Javascript, Python, PHP, BASH, Bourne Shell,
    C Shell, AWK, PowerShell, TCL, Maple, R

Due to the limited ability to recognize programming langauges, some common
file extensions can lead comments to be mislabelled (for example, .m files
are currently recognized as Maple instead of the more common Objective-C).

In order to turn off comment recognition, use the command line argument "-c"
before the appropriate filename.  Turning comments off currently does not
work for globbed files.


STDIN =========================================================================

To type a file from STDIN instead of using a file, use the argument "-s" in
place of a filename.  Text can then be pasted into the command line in order
to be used for typing practice.

Currently nctyping does not support piping from the commandline to the program
using STDIN.


INSTALL =======================================================================

From the nctyping directory, nctyping can be installed by running:

    $ gcc -o nctyping nctyping.c -lncurses

and optionally:

    # mv nctyping /usr/bin

In order to build the program you will need to have gcc and ncurses installed.
On debian/ubuntu systems this can be done with

    # apt-get install gcc libncurses5-dev
