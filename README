nctyping -- light CLI for practicing typing


INSTALL =======================================================================

From the nctyping directory, nctyping can be installed by running:

    $ gcc -o nctyping nctyping.c -lncurses

and optionally:

    # mv nctyping /usr/bin

In order to build the program you will need to have gcc and ncurses installed.
On debian/ubuntu systems this can be done with

    # apt-get install gcc libncurses5-dev


SAVING ========================================================================

If you pause anytime during a typing session (by pressing ESCAPE) or if you
finish a typing session, you will be given the option to save your progress by
pressing the 's' key on the results screen.  This generates a single save file
at $HOME/.nctyping-restore.  Each time you start nctyping, your previous save
position is loaded from the save file for whichever file you are working on.


COMMENTS ======================================================================

nctyping recognizes and skips over comments in source code.  Recognition is
currently based on file extensions or leading "shebangs" (#!).  Currently
supported language and syntax combinations include:

    C, C++, C#, Java, Rust, D, Javascript, Python, PHP, BASH, Bourne Shell,
    C Shell, AWK, PowerShell, TCL, Maple, R

Due to the limited ability to recognize programming langauges, some common
file extensions can lead comments to be mislabelled (for example, .m files
are currently recognized as Maple instead of the more common Objective-C).

In order to turn off comment recognition, use the command line argument "-c"
before the appropriate filename.  Turning comments off currently does not
work for globbed files.


STDIN =========================================================================

To type a file from STDIN instead of using a file, use the argument "-s" in
place of a filename.  Text can then be pasted into the command line in order
to be used for typing practice.

Currently nctyping does not support piping from the commandline to the program
using STDIN.
